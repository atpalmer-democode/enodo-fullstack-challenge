# Project Notes

Error handling, configuration, security, performance and other production-ready details have not been thoroughly considered.

## Data Notes

The original data for the following addresses contains multiple rows with a non-unique address:

    * 1248 W JACKSON BLVD, CHICAGO, IL
    * 2101 W OHIO ST, CHICAGO, IL
    * 2525 W CORTEZ ST, CHICAGO, IL
    * 300 S DAMEN AVE, CHICAGO, IL

For this exercise, these rows were deleted from the application database, but would require further investigation for a production application.
